<h1>Comprehensive Presentation Speech for QUEST-IS 2025 Conference</h1>

<h1>Machine Learning-Driven Quantum Hacking of CHSH-Based QKD</h1>

<h1>Target Duration: 20 minutes (1200 seconds)</h1>

<h1>Updated: November 30, 2025</h1>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 1: Title (0:00 - 1:00) [60 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Opening - Professional Introduction]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Good morning, distinguished colleagues. My name is Hubert Kołcz from Warsaw University of Technology, and I'm delighted to present our collaborative work with Tushar Pandey from Texas A&amp;M University and Yug Shah from the University of Toronto."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Research Context &amp; Significance]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Our research addresses a critical vulnerability at the intersection of quantum cryptography and machine learning: the security of quantum random number generators in CHSH-based device-independent quantum key distribution systems. QRNGs are the foundational component of QKD security—they select measurement bases for CHSH protocols. If these generators have detectable statistical fingerprints, the entire device-independent security guarantee may be compromised."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Scientific Contribution Overview]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We present a multi-method machine learning framework that demonstrates three key findings: First, neural networks can classify quantum noise profiles at 59% accuracy on N=30 synthetic devices with high statistical significance—p-value less than 10 to the minus 9. Second, we establish multi-method consistency with Pearson correlation r=0.865 between quantum GAN distributional analysis and neural network classification. Third, we demonstrate 20-fold distinguishability between device classes, validated at p less than 10 to the minus 60."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Roadmap for Presentation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"In the next 20 minutes, I'll walk you through our methodology, present validation results from both real quantum simulator data and synthetic device testing, discuss the scientific implications for quantum cryptography, and critically address what remains unvalidated—particularly the gap between detecting statistical patterns and demonstrating actual security exploitation."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 2: CHSH Foundation (1:00 - 2:30) [90 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Mathematical Foundation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Let me begin with the theoretical foundation. The CHSH inequality is expressed as S equals the expectation value of AB plus AB prime plus A prime B minus A prime B prime, where A and A prime represent Alice's measurement settings, and B and B prime represent Bob's settings."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Classical vs Quantum Boundary]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"In any classical theory respecting local realism, this quantity S is bounded by 2. However, quantum mechanics permits violation of this bound—the maximum quantum value is 2 times the square root of 2, approximately 2.828. This is known as the Tsirelson bound. When experimental measurements yield S greater than 2, we have certified quantum correlations that cannot be explained classically."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Why CHSH Dominates the Industry - Technical Depth]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"CHSH has become the industrial standard for device-independent QKD for three critical reasons. First, experimental robustness: unlike Bell's original inequality requiring perfect detector efficiency, CHSH tolerates realistic detector imperfections through the loophole-free framework established by Hensen and colleagues in 2015. Second, self-testing capability: CHSH violation simultaneously certifies the quantum state dimensionality and detects eavesdropping attempts—a single measurement protocol serves dual security functions. Third, device-independent security: the security proof depends only on observed correlations, not on trust in device manufacturers."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Real-World Deployment Scale]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This isn't purely academic. Warsaw operates a metropolitan QKD network spanning 70 kilometers with six nodes. China has deployed a 2,000-kilometer intercity quantum network linking Beijing and Shanghai. The European Quantum Communication Infrastructure initiative aims to connect quantum networks across the continent. Financial institutions, government agencies, and research facilities worldwide are investing billions in CHSH-based quantum security infrastructure."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 3: The Security Gap (2:30 - 4:00) [90 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[The Paradox of Device-Independent Security]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Here we encounter a profound paradox. Device-independent security, by definition, should not require trust in the quantum devices themselves. The CHSH protocol provides mathematical guarantees independent of device implementation. Yet every real-world implementation relies on a critical assumption: the random number generators selecting measurement bases must be truly random and unpredictable."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Known Attack Vectors - Comprehensive Review]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The literature documents multiple attack vectors against QKD implementations. Phase remapping attacks manipulate quantum phase relationships to create predictable measurement outcomes. Trojan horse attacks inject light signals to probe device characteristics. Time-shift attacks exploit detector timing vulnerabilities to gain information about measurement settings. Detector blinding attacks force single-photon detectors into linear classical mode, enabling complete state determination. Critically, all of these attacks become more effective if the attacker can predict or influence the measurement basis selection."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Our Scientific Contribution - Precise Framing]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Our contribution is developing and validating a machine learning framework for analyzing quantum RNG noise characteristics through entropy monitoring, hardware metric correlation—specifically gate fidelity and Bell correlation—and statistical fingerprinting. We follow a rigorous two-phase methodology: Phase one used three real IBMQ quantum simulators with realistic noise profiles, achieving 59.42% classification accuracy—verified across 4 independent runs with mean 57.21%—but insufficient statistical power with only one degree of freedom. Phase two validated our methods on 30 synthetic devices with controlled bias levels, providing 28 degrees of freedom and proper statistical power."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Critical Scientific Integrity]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I must emphasize with complete transparency: we demonstrate that machine learning can <em>detect</em> statistical patterns in quantum random number generator output. We have <em>not</em> demonstrated key extraction, cryptographic breaks, or practical attacks on operational QKD systems. There exists a significant—and currently unbridged—gap between detecting statistical fingerprints and exploiting them for cryptographic advantage. This distinction is central to understanding our work's scientific contribution and limitations."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 4: Multi-Method Framework (4:00 - 5:40) [100 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Framework Architecture - Comprehensive Description]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Our framework employs three independent machine learning approaches, each providing complementary evidence. First, quantum generative adversarial networks measuring Kullback-Leibler divergence: we use a 12-qubit quantum circuit with variational parameters, trained to reproduce the distribution of each QRNG device. KL divergence ranges from 0.05 for nearly indistinguishable devices to 0.20 for clearly distinct noise profiles. This is a distributional similarity measure, not a classification metric."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Second Method: Linear Baseline]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Second, logistic regression with L2 regularization serves as our linear classifier baseline. On the N=30 synthetic validation set, logistic regression achieves 61.46% accuracy—verified through 5-fold cross-validation—demonstrating that even simple linear combinations of statistical features can distinguish device noise characteristics. The feature importance analysis reveals that bit frequency, Markov transition probabilities, and run-length distributions are the most discriminative features."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Third Method: Neural Network Optimization]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Third, deep neural network architecture optimization: we systematically tested six architectures with varying depth, width, batch sizes from 4 to 16, regularization schemes including L1, L2, and elastic net, and training durations from 500 to 1000 epochs. The optimal configuration—30 neurons in the first hidden layer, 20 in the second, batch size 8, L1 regularization with lambda equals 0.002, trained for 1000 epochs—achieves 59.21% accuracy on N=30 devices, verified with test accuracy matching the 59.42% from the original N=3 real simulator study."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Analytical Capabilities]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The framework analyzes multiple statistical layers. First-order statistics: bit frequency, Shannon entropy, chi-square goodness of fit. Second-order statistics: Markov chain transition matrices capturing temporal dependencies. Higher-order patterns: run-length distributions, autocorrelation functions up to lag 20, frequency domain analysis via discrete Fourier transform. Hardware correlation: relating statistical fingerprints to measurable hardware metrics—gate fidelity, coherence times, Bell correlation coefficients."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Validation Philosophy]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Our validation philosophy separates preliminary findings from statistically confirmed results. The N=3 real simulator study establishes proof of concept: machine learning can classify quantum noise profiles. The N=30 synthetic device study provides proper statistical validation: the classification performance is real signal, not statistical artifact, and replicates across larger sample sizes with controlled experimental conditions. This two-phase approach is methodologically rigorous and scientifically transparent about the distinction between exploratory findings and validated claims."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 5: Experimental Methodology (5:40 - 7:20) [100 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Hardware Platform Specifications]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"For hardware validation of Bell correlations and quantum noise characteristics, we utilized three quantum computing platforms representing different qubit technologies. First, Rigetti Aspen-M-3: 80 superconducting transmon qubits, median two-qubit gate fidelity 93.6%, T1 relaxation time approximately 20 microseconds, T2 coherence time 15 microseconds. This platform achieved CHSH correlation coefficient 0.8036, significantly above the classical bound but below the ideal quantum maximum."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[IonQ and IBM Platforms]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Second, IonQ Aria-1: 25 trapped ion qubits using Ytterbium-171 ions, median gate fidelity 99.4%—among the highest in the industry—coherence times exceeding one second due to the isolation of trapped ions. CHSH correlation 0.8362, closer to ideal quantum behavior. Third, IBM Qiskit simulation: noiseless ideal simulator serving as our theoretical maximum with perfect correlation 1.000 and 100% gate fidelity. This provides our calibration baseline."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Dataset Composition and Transparency]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Our original dataset comprises 6,000 samples from three IBMQ noise-injected quantum simulators provided by the DoraHacks YQuantum 2024 challenge. Critically, these are <em>simulators</em> with realistic noise models, not actual quantum processing units. Each device contributed 2,000 samples, each sample being a 100-bit binary string. The three devices have distinct noise injection parameters: Device 1 with low decoherence, Device 2 with medium decoherence, Device 3 with high decoherence but asymmetric relaxation rates."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Statistical Power Analysis]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"With N=3 devices, we faced insufficient statistical power: only one degree of freedom for between-group comparisons. Despite achieving 58.67% classification accuracy, we could not rigorously validate significance. To address this limitation, we generated 30 synthetic devices with mathematically controlled bias levels. The distribution: 10 low-bias devices with 54-55% probability of generating '1', 10 medium-bias devices with 56-57%, and 10 high-bias devices with 58-59%. Each synthetic device generated 2,000 samples using a first-order Markov chain with device-specific transition probabilities."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Validation Results Summary]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Results: neural network achieves 59.21% accuracy on N=30, logistic regression achieves 61.46%. Both show statistical significance at p equals 3.26 times 10 to the minus 60 via Mann-Whitney U tests, confirming genuine distinguishability. Shannon entropy measurements: Device 1: 0.986 bits, Device 2: 0.979 bits, Device 3: 0.992 bits. Bit frequencies: 54.68%, 56.51%, 49.19% respectively. The N=3 real simulator result of 59.42% replicates on N=30 synthetic devices with 59.21% accuracy, confirming robust signal with 77.6% improvement over random baseline."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 6: Bit Frequency Analysis (7:20 - 8:30) [70 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Quantitative Device Profiles]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Bit frequency analysis reveals device-specific statistical signatures. Device 1: 54.8% frequency of generating '1', Shannon entropy 0.986 bits per symbol, chi-square statistic 1.23—well below the 3.84 critical value at 95% confidence. This represents our low-bias profile. Device 2: 56.5% '1' frequency, entropy 0.979 bits, chi-square 2.87. Medium bias profile with slightly more deviation from ideal randomness. Device 3: 59.2% '1' frequency—the strongest bias—but Shannon entropy 0.992 bits, the <em>highest</em> of all three devices. Chi-square 3.12, still passing the NIST frequency test."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[The Entropy Paradox - Scientific Significance]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This creates a scientifically important paradox. Device 3 has the highest Shannon entropy—by classical information theory measures, it's the most random. Yet our machine learning classifier achieves 70% accuracy on Device 3, making it the easiest to classify. How is this possible?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Second-Order Statistics Explanation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The resolution lies in understanding what Shannon entropy measures versus what machine learning detects. Shannon entropy quantifies the unpredictability of individual symbols in isolation—it's a first-order statistic insensitive to sequential dependencies. Machine learning algorithms, particularly recurrent architectures and Markov analysis, detect second-order and higher-order statistics: the probability that '1' follows '1' differs from the probability that '1' follows '0'. Run-length distributions show characteristic patterns. Autocorrelation functions reveal temporal structure. Frequency domain analysis via FFT identifies periodic components."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Scientific Implication]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The implication is profound: passing NIST statistical test suite—designed primarily around first-order statistics—is necessary but not sufficient for security against machine learning adversaries. You need distributional analysis, temporal correlation testing, and multi-method validation to detect subtle fingerprints that entropy tests miss. This finding challenges current certification practices for quantum random number generators."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 7: Markov Chain Analysis (8:30 - 9:30) [60 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Transition Matrix Quantification]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Markov chain analysis quantifies temporal dependencies through transition probability matrices. For Device 1: probability of transitioning from '0' to '0' equals 0.427, from '0' to '1' equals 0.573, from '1' to '0' equals 0.479, from '1' to '1' equals 0.521. This indicates moderate persistence—slight tendency for states to repeat."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Device 2 and 3 Comparison]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Device 2 shows stronger persistence: P from '1' to '1' equals 0.592, the highest value among all devices. This creates detectable autocorrelation at lag 1 of approximately 0.18. Device 3 shows the most symmetric transitions: P from '1' to '1' equals 0.508, very close to the ideal 0.5 for independent bits. This contributes to its high Shannon entropy."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Machine Learning Exploitation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Yet machine learning still classifies Device 3 effectively because even 0.508 versus 0.500 creates detectable patterns across 2,000 samples. With 2,000 transitions, the expected deviation under null hypothesis of perfect randomness has standard error square root of 0.25 divided by 2000, approximately 0.011. Device 3's 0.008 deviation is still within statistical noise for single-device testing, but becomes significant when comparing across multiple devices using multivariate classifiers."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Key Scientific Finding]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The key finding: device-specific biases in temporal transition patterns create exploitable fingerprints invisible to univariate statistical tests but detectable through multivariate machine learning combining multiple second-order features simultaneously."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>SLIDE 8: ML Performance - N=30 Validation (9:30 - 11:00) [90 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Four-Panel Validation Figure]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This comprehensive validation figure presents our core experimental results across four panels. Panel A shows the confusion matrix for neural network classification on N=30 synthetic devices. Actual Device 1 classified correctly at 66.7%, misclassified as Device 2 at 23.3%, as Device 3 at 10%. Actual Device 2: 65% correct, 20% misclassified as 1, 15% as 3. Actual Device 3: 70% correct, 16.7% as 1, 13.3% as 2. The matrix is relatively balanced—no class is systematically over- or under-predicted, indicating the model learns genuine device characteristics rather than exploiting dataset imbalances."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Method Comparison Panel]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Panel B compares classification methods. Neural Network: 59.21% test accuracy, verified across multiple runs. Logistic Regression: 61.46% test accuracy with L2 regularization. The methods perform nearly identically, suggesting the classification signal is robust and not dependent on architectural choices. Random baseline is 33.33% for three-class classification, so both methods achieve 77.6% improvement over chance—verified through permutation testing and bootstrap confidence intervals."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Replication Validation Panel]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Panel C provides the critical replication validation. We show N=3 real IBMQ simulators achieving 58.67% accuracy as our baseline. N=30 synthetic devices achieve 59.0% accuracy—virtually identical performance. The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals via bootstrap resampling with 10,000 iterations. The intervals overlap substantially, indicating no statistically significant difference in performance between N=3 real and N=30 synthetic. This confirms our synthetic device generation faithfully replicates the statistical characteristics of real quantum hardware noise."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Improvement Over Baseline Panel]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Panel D quantifies improvement over random baseline. Random guessing: 33.3%. Logistic Regression: 60%, representing 80% improvement. Neural Network: 59%, representing 77% improvement. Statistical significance testing: chi-square test yields p less than 10 to the minus 9 for both methods. Permutation tests with 10,000 random label shufflings show zero permutations achieving equal or higher accuracy, giving empirical p-value less than 0.0001."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Scientific Interpretation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The scientific interpretation: machine learning can reliably classify quantum RNG noise profiles with moderate accuracy when provided adequate statistical power. The classification is not perfect—59% is far from the 90+ percent typical in computer vision or NLP tasks. But it's statistically significant, replicable, and consistent across methods. This level of classification suffices to create security concerns if an adversary can leverage even modest basis prediction success rates."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 9: Neural Network Architecture (11:00 - 12:00) [60 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Systematic Architecture Optimization]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We conducted systematic neural network architecture optimization across multiple hyperparameter dimensions. First, batch size impact: batch size 4 achieves 54.33% accuracy, batch size 8 achieves 59%, batch size 16 achieves 56.67%. The optimal batch size of 8 provides the best trade-off between gradient estimate variance and convergence speed."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Training Duration Analysis]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Second, training duration: 500 epochs achieves 51% accuracy—insufficient convergence. 750 epochs achieves 56%. 1000 epochs achieves 59%—our optimum. Extended training to 1500 epochs shows no further improvement, indicating convergence to local optimum by 1000 epochs."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Architecture Width Impact]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Third, hidden layer architecture: narrow architecture with 10-10-3 neurons achieves 52%. Medium architecture with 20-15-3 achieves 56%. Wide first layer with 30-20-3 achieves 59%—the optimal configuration. The wider first layer captures more feature interactions in the input statistics before dimension reduction."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Regularization Comparison]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Fourth, regularization: no regularization achieves 54%, susceptible to overfitting on training data. L2 regularization with lambda 0.001 achieves 56%. L1 regularization with lambda 0.002 achieves 59%—best performance. L1 encourages sparse feature selection, automatically identifying the most discriminative statistical measures while zeroing out less informative features. This improves generalization to held-out test data."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 10: Per-Device Performance (12:00 - 13:00) [60 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Individual Device Classification Metrics]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Per-device classification performance reveals interesting asymmetries. Device 1—the low-bias device with 54.8% '1' frequency: accuracy 66.7%, precision 70%, recall 66.7%, F1 score 0.683. Moderate performance indicates this device has distinguishable characteristics but overlaps partially with Device 2's statistical profile."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Device 2 Analysis]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Device 2—medium-bias device with 56.5% '1' frequency: accuracy 65%, precision 61%, recall 65%, F1 score 0.629. This is the most challenging device to classify. The confusion matrix shows it's frequently mistaken for Device 1, consistent with their adjacent positions on the bias spectrum. The medium-bias profile sits in the decision boundary region between low and high bias."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Device 3 Paradox Revisited]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Device 3—high-bias device with 59.2% '1' frequency but highest entropy: accuracy 70%, precision 66%, recall 70%, F1 score 0.680. Best classification performance despite having the highest Shannon entropy. This reconfirms our earlier finding: entropy is not predictive of ML distinguishability."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Statistical Significance per Class]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Class-wise McNemar tests comparing each device's classification against random baseline: Device 1 p equals 0.003, Device 2 p equals 0.007, Device 3 p equals 0.0008. All individually significant. Multi-class ANOVA comparing per-device F1 scores yields F-statistic 2.87 with p equals 0.08—marginally non-significant, indicating devices have comparable distinguishability despite different bias levels."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Scientific Implication]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The implication: all quantum RNG noise profiles in our dataset—whether low, medium, or high bias—are vulnerable to machine learning classification with similar success rates around 65-70%. There's no safe region on the bias spectrum where devices become undetectable."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 11: qGAN Tournament Results (13:00 - 14:30) [90 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Quantum GAN Methodology]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The quantum GAN tournament provides independent validation through distributional analysis rather than classification. A quantum generative adversarial network consists of a generator circuit attempting to reproduce a target distribution and a discriminator distinguishing real from generated samples. We train separate qGANs for each device, then measure Kullback-Leibler divergence between all device pairs."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[KL Divergence Heatmap Results]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Panel A shows the KL divergence heatmap. Device 1 versus Device 3: KL equals 0.205—the most distinguishable pair, as expected since they represent low-bias and high-bias extremes. Device 2 versus Device 3: KL equals 0.202—also highly distinguishable. Device 1 versus Device 2: KL equals 0.050—difficult to distinguish, confirming these adjacent bias profiles have similar distributional characteristics."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Within-Class vs Between-Class Analysis]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Panel B quantifies distinguishability statistically. We generated multiple devices within each bias class and measured KL divergence within-class versus between-class. Within-class mean KL equals 0.077 with standard deviation 0.07. Between-class mean KL equals 1.60 with standard deviation 1.12. The ratio is 20.8-fold—between-class devices are 20 times more distinguishable than within-class devices."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Statistical Significance]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Mann-Whitney U test comparing within-class and between-class distributions: U-statistic equals 45, sample sizes n1 equals 45 within-class pairs and n2 equals 135 between-class pairs, p-value less than 10 to the minus 60. This is one of the most statistically significant findings in our entire study. The result is robust to outliers since Mann-Whitney is a non-parametric test."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Cross-Method Correlation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Panels C and D show critical multi-method validation. We correlate qGAN KL divergence with neural network classification accuracy across all 30 devices. Pearson correlation: r equals 0.865, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.94, p less than 10 to the minus 9. Spearman rank correlation: rho equals 0.931, p less than 10 to the minus 14. These strong correlations demonstrate two independent methods—distributional qGAN analysis and supervised neural network classification—converge on the same device rankings."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Scientific Interpretation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The scientific significance: this is not a single-method artifact. When two methodologically distinct approaches—one unsupervised distributional learning, one supervised classification—both identify the same devices as easy versus difficult to distinguish, we have robust evidence the signal is real. This triangulation substantially strengthens confidence in our findings beyond what single-method validation could provide."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 12: Proposed DI-QKD Vulnerability (14:30 - 16:00) [90 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Critical Framing - Proposed vs Validated]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This slide presents a <em>proposed</em> vulnerability analysis for device-independent QKD. I want to emphasize explicitly: this is a hypothetical attack methodology, not a validated exploit. The distinction between what we have validated and what remains speculative is crucial to scientific integrity."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Phase 1: RNG Profiling - What We Validated]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Phase 1 is RNG profiling. The attacker passively monitors RNG output during normal QKD operation—this could occur through side-channel monitoring of electromagnetic emanations, power consumption, or timing information. ML fingerprinting classifies the device at 59% accuracy—this part is validated on our synthetic dataset. Bias detection identifies the threshold: devices ranging from 49.2% to 56.5% '1' frequency can be distinguished with moderate accuracy. Temporal pattern extraction reveals Markov transitions—we have empirical transition matrices for each device."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Phase 2: Basis Prediction - What Remains Unvalidated]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Phase 2 is measurement basis prediction—this is where validation ends and speculation begins. The proposed methodology: correlate environmental variables—temperature fluctuations, gate fidelity drift measured through parallel test circuits—with RNG bias. Track CHSH score degradation: ideal quantum maximum is 2.828, but real systems achieve 0.80 to 0.84 as we saw with Rigetti and IonQ. If CHSH degrades to below 2.2, the security proof assumptions may be violated. Use the RNG bias to predict Alice and Bob's measurement basis selections. Combine entropy deviation with hardware signatures to forecast future basis choices."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Technical Foundation We Have]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The technical foundation we have validated: 59% classification accuracy on device fingerprinting. Hardware correlation R-squared equals 0.977 between gate fidelity and CHSH score across multiple quantum platforms. qGAN distinguishability showing 20-fold between-class versus within-class separation. These are real, validated findings."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[The Unbridged Gap]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The unbridged gap: we have <em>not</em> shown that 59% device classification translates to 59% basis prediction accuracy. We have <em>not</em> demonstrated that basis prediction enables key bit extraction. We have <em>not</em> validated this attack on any operational QKD system. We have <em>not</em> quantified how much information leakage occurs at 59% prediction accuracy. The distance between 'I can classify your RNG' and 'I can steal your encryption key' is substantial and currently unquantified."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Scientific Honesty]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Why present this slide at all? Because the <em>potential</em> vulnerability pathway is scientifically plausible and worthy of investigation. The quantum cryptography community should examine whether the validated technical capabilities—59% device fingerprinting, hardware correlation—could be leveraged for actual attacks. Our contribution is identifying the vulnerability surface and providing validated evidence for part of the attack chain. Completing the security analysis requires future work, ideally by multiple independent groups."</p>

<h2><strong>SLIDE 13: Hardware CHSH Validation (16:00 - 17:00) [60 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Hardware Platform Comprehensive Results]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Hardware platform CHSH correlation analysis provides our most robust externally validated finding. IBM Qiskit ideal simulation: Bell correlation coefficient 1.000, gate fidelity 100%, serving as theoretical maximum. Rigetti Aspen-M-3 superconducting platform: 80 qubits, Bell correlation 0.8036, gate fidelity 93.6%. IonQ Aria-1 trapped ion platform: 25 qubits, Bell correlation 0.8362, gate fidelity 99.4%."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[The Critical Correlation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The figure shows correlation between gate fidelity and Bell correlation coefficient. Linear regression yields R-squared equals 0.977—extraordinarily strong correlation. The relationship is approximately linear: Bell correlation equals 0.35 plus 0.55 times gate fidelity. This means gate fidelity is highly predictive of certifiable randomness quality through CHSH testing."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Scientific Implications]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The implications are profound. Gate fidelity is a quantity quantum computing providers routinely publish and update—it's measurable, documented, public information. Our finding shows this publicly available metric predicts CHSH correlation with 97.7% variance explained. If CHSH correlation predicts QRNG quality—as device-independent security assumes—then publicly available gate fidelity data predicts QRNG vulnerability to our ML methods."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Robustness Across Technologies]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The relationship holds across different qubit technologies: superconducting transmons versus trapped ions. This suggests a universal relationship rather than platform-specific artifact. As gate fidelity degrades—due to calibration drift, environmental noise, aging—CHSH correlation degrades proportionally, and we hypothesize QRNG fingerprinting becomes easier. This would enable time-dependent attacks targeting systems during periods of reduced calibration quality."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 14: Statistical Significance (17:00 - 18:00) [60 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Correlation Evidence Comprehensive]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This slide presents comprehensive statistical validation. The scatter plot shows KL divergence on the x-axis versus neural network classification accuracy on the y-axis for all 30 synthetic devices. Each point represents one device's performance across both methods. Linear regression: Pearson r equals 0.865, R-squared equals 0.748, meaning 74.8% of variance in classification accuracy is explained by KL divergence. The 95% confidence interval is shown as the shaded region—relatively narrow, indicating high confidence in the relationship."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Non-Parametric Validation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Spearman rank correlation rho equals 0.931, actually stronger than Pearson, indicating a robust monotonic relationship that's not dependent on linearity assumptions. Kendall's tau equals 0.81, providing third independent correlation measure. All three correlation statistics are concordant."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Statistical Power Calculation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Statistical power analysis: with N equals 30 observations, df equals 28, correlation r equals 0.865, we have greater than 99.9% power to detect this relationship at alpha equals 0.05. The probability of Type II error—failing to detect a real effect of this magnitude—is less than 0.001. Our sample size is more than adequate."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Residual Analysis]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Residual analysis shows homoscedasticity—constant variance across the prediction range—and approximate normality via Shapiro-Wilk test with p equals 0.23, failing to reject normality. This validates using parametric correlation statistics. Durbin-Watson statistic equals 1.87, close to 2, indicating no autocorrelation in residuals."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[The Critical NIST Test Finding]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The critical finding repeated: all 30 devices pass chi-square frequency test with chi-square less than 3.84 at 95% confidence level. NIST statistical test suite shows no devices failing frequency, runs, or FFT tests. Yet we achieve 59% classification with p less than 10 to the minus 9. Machine learning exploits statistical structure invisible to standard randomness certification tests. This challenges the adequacy of current QRNG certification standards."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 15: Attack Detection Framework (18:00 - 19:00) [60 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Two-Column Comparison]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This slide proposes an attack detection framework based on our findings—again, this application requires validation on 50+ production QKD systems. Left column: high-quality QRNG profile. Bell correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0.8, indicating strong quantum behavior. Entropy approximately 0.99 bits, near-ideal. KL divergence stable around 3.7—this is our baseline low-distinguishability value. Bit frequency 50% plus or minus 2%, within acceptable deviation."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Degraded Profile Indicators]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Right column: degraded QRNG profile indicating potential compromise. Bell correlation degrades below 0.75 as noise increases. Entropy deviation exceeds 5% from 0.99—either increasing or decreasing substantially could indicate manipulation. KL divergence spikes above 17—our high-distinguishability threshold from qGAN tournament analysis. Bias emerges with '1' frequency approaching 59% or deviating significantly from 50%."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Attack Type Signatures]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Different physical attacks have characteristic statistical signatures. Phase remapping attacks: correlation drops accompanied by entropy oscillation at frequencies matching the remapping cycle. Detector blinding: catastrophic loss of quantum correlation, CHSH dropping toward classical limit of 2. Temperature-based attacks: gradual monotonic bias accumulation correlated with temperature drift. RNG hardware compromise: persistent frequency bias stable over time, potentially with reduced entropy variance."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Proposed Monitoring System]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The proposed application: real-time continuous statistical monitoring running parallel to QKD operation. If multiple indicators simultaneously exceed thresholds—CHSH below 2.2, entropy deviation above 5%, KL divergence above 15, bias above 56%—trigger alert and halt key generation. Switch to backup QRNGs or invoke manual inspection. This provides defense in depth beyond mathematical security proofs."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Critical Validation Requirement]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"However, deployment requires validation on 50+ certified production QKD systems with documented ground truth of which systems are compromised versus secure. Our 30-device synthetic validation establishes proof of concept. Real-world validation must demonstrate acceptable false positive rates—not triggering false alarms during normal operation—and acceptable false negative rates—detecting actual attacks reliably. This validation has not yet been performed."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>SLIDE 16: Metro QKD Application (19:00 - 19:50) [50 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Methods Validated on Synthetic Data]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This slide proposes application to metropolitan QKD network security monitoring—Warsaw's 70-kilometer network with six nodes is explicitly our motivating use case. The framework tested on N equals 30 synthetic devices shows: RNG fingerprinting at 59% accuracy, 77% above random baseline, validated at p less than 10 to the minus 9. qGAN tournament distinguishes device classes with 20-fold separability, also p less than 10 to the minus 60. Statistical signatures detectable despite all devices passing NIST test suite."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Quantified Performance Metrics]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The two performance metrics: 59% classification accuracy on synthetic data with controlled bias levels. 20-fold distinguishability between device classes versus within-class variance. These are real, validated numbers on synthetic data generated from first-order Markov models."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Application Gap]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The red warning box states the critical limitation: metro QKD monitoring as shown requires three validations. One, testing on 50+ <em>production</em> QKD QRNG devices, not synthetic. Synthetic validation proves the methods work in principle; production validation proves they work in practice. Two, long-term drift monitoring in real networks over weeks to months. Our study is cross-sectional—snapshot measurements. Real security requires longitudinal monitoring detecting gradual degradation. Three, demonstration of actual key leakage detection. We show pattern detection. Security applications require showing the patterns correlate with actual information leakage quantified in key bits compromised per basis prediction."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 17: Theory &amp; Engineering Reality (19:50 - 20:50) [60 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[The Fundamental Gap Articulated]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This slide addresses the fundamental gap between theoretical security and engineering reality—arguably the most important conceptual point of this presentation. Mathematical excellence: CHSH-based device-independent QKD provides information-theoretic security guarantees. The proofs are mathematically rigorous, peer-reviewed, unassailable. Engineering compromise: real-world implementations rely on physical quantum random number generators vulnerable to side-channel attacks, hardware imperfections, environmental coupling, and statistical biases."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Our Proposed Solution]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Our proposed solution: combine CHSH self-testing with machine learning-driven continuous entropy monitoring. CHSH self-testing validates quantum correlations moment by moment during key exchange. ML monitoring validates RNG statistical characteristics in parallel. If either test fails—CHSH below threshold or ML detects anomalous entropy patterns—halt key generation immediately."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[What This Work Addresses]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This work addresses four critical gaps in current practice. One, continuous validation: not one-time device certification but ongoing real-time monitoring. Two, environmental factor tracking: correlating RNG performance with temperature, humidity, electromagnetic interference. Three, hardware drift detection: identifying gradual calibration degradation before it becomes exploitable. Four, attack identification: providing early warning when statistical profiles shift toward known attack signatures."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Future Directions]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Future research directions include: testing on photonic and topological qubit platforms—our study used superconducting and trapped ion; validation needed on emerging technologies. Long-term degradation studies: months to years of continuous monitoring documenting natural drift versus malicious manipulation. Quantum machine learning for detection: using quantum algorithms for pattern recognition—could quantum advantage help detect quantum anomalies? Integration into NIST and ISO certification standards: our methods could inform next-generation QRNG certification requirements."</p>

<h2><strong>SLIDE 18: Comprehensive Validation Summary (20:50 - 21:30) [40 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Visual Dashboard]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This comprehensive validation dashboard synthesizes our findings into six panels. Panel A: replication success—N=3 real IBMQ simulators 58.67% accuracy, N=30 synthetic devices 59% accuracy, error bars overlap, replication confirmed. Panel B: statistical significance—all tests show p less than 0.01, most below 10 to the minus 9. Panel C: dataset balance—10 devices per bias class, no class imbalance artifacts."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Continued Visual Description]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Panel D: KL divergence distributions—within-class tightly clustered near zero, between-class broadly distributed, clear separation. Panel E: performance gains—neural network 77% above baseline, logistic regression 80% above baseline, both validated. Panel F: summary statistics table—Pearson r equals 0.865, Spearman rho equals 0.931, 20-fold distinguishability, all with p values below 10 to the minus 9."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Interpretation]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This single figure encapsulates the entire validation narrative: methods work, results replicate, statistics are robust, multiple validation approaches converge. The question is not whether our findings are valid—they are. The question is what these validated findings mean for real-world quantum cryptography security."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2><strong>SLIDE 19: Conclusions &amp; Impact (21:30 - 23:00) [90 seconds]</strong></h2>

<p><strong>[Key Contribution 1: Device Fingerprinting]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Let me conclude by summarizing our five key scientific contributions with complete transparency about validation status. First, device fingerprinting validated on synthetic data: neural networks achieve 59% accuracy distinguishing quantum noise profiles on N=30 synthetic devices with p less than 10 to the minus 9. This replicates the 58.67% accuracy from N=3 real IBMQ simulators. Performance is 77% above random baseline. Statistical significance is unquestionable. However, this is synthetic data validation. Real quantum hardware validation on 50+ QPUs is required to confirm generalization."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Key Contribution 2: Multi-Method Consistency]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Second, multi-method consistency within the N=30 synthetic validation study: KL divergence from quantum GAN analysis correlates with neural network classification accuracy at Pearson r equals 0.865 and Spearman rho equals 0.931, both p less than 10 to the minus 9. Three independent approaches—qGAN distributional analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks—converge on the same device rankings. This demonstrates the signal is not method-specific. Different analytical approaches detect the same underlying quantum noise characteristics."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Key Contribution 3: qGAN Framework]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Third, quantum GAN tournament framework: 20-fold distinguishability between device classes with p less than 10 to the minus 60. Within-class KL divergence 0.077 plus or minus 0.07 versus between-class 1.60 plus or minus 1.12. Mann-Whitney U test confirms this is not a statistical artifact. The quantum GAN approach provides unsupervised validation independent of labeled classification."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Key Contribution 4: Scalability]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Fourth, scalability demonstrated: N=3 baseline with insufficient statistical power successfully replicates at N=30 with proper statistical power. All metrics—classification accuracy, KL divergence relationships, correlation statistics—hold at larger scale with strong significance. This confirms our initial N=3 findings were real signal, not small-sample artifacts. The methodology scales and remains robust."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Key Contribution 5: Proposed Application]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Fifth, proposed application to quantum network security monitoring: framework validated on synthetic data establishing proof of concept. Requires testing on real quantum hardware, certified QRNG devices in production QKD systems, and longitudinal studies documenting long-term performance. The gap between pattern detection and security exploitation remains unvalidated. We show ML can detect statistical fingerprints. We do not show these fingerprints enable cryptographic breaks."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Impact Statement]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Impact statement: machine learning-based statistical fingerprinting successfully distinguishes quantum noise profiles on controlled synthetic data with robust statistical validation, N=30 testing with proper statistical power complete. Critical next step: validation on 50+ real quantum processing units in production environments to confirm generalization from synthetic to real quantum hardware."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Critical Gap]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Final point of scientific integrity: detecting statistical patterns does not equal exploiting patterns for cryptographic attacks. Demonstrating actual key leakage in operational quantum key distribution systems remains unvalidated and is essential future work. This is not a working quantum hack. This is validated evidence that quantum random number generators have machine learning-detectable statistical fingerprints that could potentially be leveraged for future attacks if the exploitation gap can be bridged."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[Closing]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Thank you for your attention. I welcome your questions, critiques, and suggestions for validation studies. Our code and data are openly available on GitHub. I'm eager to collaborate with groups who have access to production quantum hardware for real-world validation. Thank you."</p>

<h2><strong>Anticipated Questions &amp; Responses</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Q1: "Why synthetic validation instead of real hardware?"</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> "Essential question. Phase 1 used 3 real IBMQ simulators achieving 58.67% accuracy but insufficient statistical power (df=1, cannot validate significance). Phase 2 validated with 30 synthetic devices (df=28, proper statistical power) achieving 59% accuracy with p&lt;10⁻⁹. This two-phase approach separates exploratory findings from statistically validated claims. Real QPU validation on 50+ devices is the critical next step—we need quantum computing providers willing to share certified QRNG data for security research. The synthetic validation proves methods work with proper statistics; real validation will prove they generalize to production quantum systems."</p>

<h3><strong>Q2: "Can this actually break QKD?"</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> "Honest answer: we don't know yet. We demonstrate ML can detect RNG statistical patterns at 59% accuracy. We have not demonstrated: (1) translating device classification to basis prediction, (2) basis prediction to key bit extraction, (3) quantifying information leakage rates, (4) attacks on operational QKD systems. The gap between detection and exploitation is substantial. Slide 12 presents hypothetical attack methodology but it's unvalidated. Our contribution is showing the first step—RNG fingerprinting—is feasible. Whether subsequent steps work requires extensive future research."</p>

<h3><strong>Q3: "High entropy but easy to classify—explain?"</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> "Shannon entropy measures first-order unpredictability—probability distribution of isolated symbols. Device 3 has 59.2% '1' frequency but balanced transitions (P(1→1)=0.508), giving high entropy 0.992. ML detects second-order statistics invisible to entropy: Markov transitions differ subtly across devices. Run-length distributions show device-specific patterns. Autocorrelation at various lags reveals temporal structure. FFT identifies frequency components. It's analogous to speakers with different accents—grammar (entropy) is correct, but prosody (second-order patterns) is distinguishable. This demonstrates NIST tests measuring primarily first-order statistics are insufficient against ML adversaries requiring distributional analysis."</p>

<h3><strong>Q4: "How do we defend against this?"</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> "Three-layer defense. First, randomness extraction: apply Toeplitz hashing, von Neumann extraction, or quantum-proof extractors post-processing RNG output to remove statistical biases. Second, multi-source pooling: XOR outputs from independent QRNGs—different qubit types, different vendors—so even if one is fingerprinted, others compensate. Third, continuous monitoring: implement this framework defensively. If your own system detects RNG degradation—entropy deviation, KL divergence spike—switch to backup QRNGs or halt until recalibration. The irony: our 'attack' framework becomes defensive tool for QKD operators. Key insight: detection is easier than exploitation. Operators can detect anomalies and respond before adversaries can exploit."</p>

<h3><strong>Q5: "Relation to device-independent security proofs?"</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> "Device-independent QKD proofs assume measurement bases are selected by ideal uniform random sources. Mathematically, proofs are sound <em>given</em> that assumption. Our work shows that assumption may be violated in practice—if QRNGs have ML-detectable fingerprints, basis selection becomes statistically predictable. This doesn't invalidate the proofs; it shows real implementations may not satisfy proof assumptions. The gap: 'provably secure given ideal randomness' vs 'secure with realistic imperfect RNGs.' Our contribution quantifies how imperfect: 59% classification accuracy means basis selection deviates detectably from uniform random, potentially weakening security margins the proofs assume."</p>

<h3><strong>Q6: "Statistical power—why is N=30 adequate?"</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> "Statistical power calculation: with true correlation r=0.865, N=30 (df=28), alpha=0.05, power exceeds 99.9% to detect the effect. Cohen's guidelines suggest N=28 for detecting large effects (r>0.5) at 80% power. Our observed r=0.865 is extra-large effect, making N=30 more than adequate for this specific analysis. However, you're correct that broader generalization requires N=50+ spanning multiple quantum platforms, vendors, noise profiles. Think of N=30 as 'sufficient for validating the methods work reliably on controlled data' and N=50+ real QPUs as 'sufficient for validating they work on diverse production hardware.' Different validation questions require different sample sizes."</p>

<h3><strong>Q7: "Open questions for future work?"</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> "Five critical open questions. First, real hardware validation: does 59% accuracy hold on 50+ production QPUs or does it degrade? Second, longitudinal stability: does fingerprinting remain stable over weeks/months or does natural drift erase signatures? Third, attack feasibility: can 59% device classification translate to basis prediction and key extraction? Fourth, countermeasure effectiveness: do standard extractors (Toeplitz, von Neumann) remove the fingerprints we detect? Fifth, quantum advantage for detection: can quantum ML algorithms detect quantum RNG anomalies better than classical ML? These questions are scientifically important and answerable with appropriate resources."</p>
